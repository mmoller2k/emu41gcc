Emu41 was compiled with Borland C++ 4.52 (actually used in pure C flavor).
Light versions (Emu41p, Emu41lx, Emu41lt) were compiled with Borland C 2.0, nutcpu2.asm was assembled with Borland Turbo Assembler.


Global conditional compilation symbols:
XIL: support of external HP-IL with HP-IL/PC board
VERS_ASM: use nutcpu2.asm
VERS_SLOW: for slow machines (8086, 186, 286)
VERS_LAP: disable HDRIVE2, FDRIVE1, LPRTER1, SERIAL2 (for Portable Plus and LX)
HPPLUS: specific for the HP Portable Plus
HPLX: specific for the HP 95/100/200LX serie
FPU: support of FPU (not implemented)

Versions and compilation symbols:
Standard version:   XIL
Light version:      VERS_SLOW, VERS_ASM, XIL
Portable Plus:      VERS_SLOW, VERS_ASM, XIL, VERS_LAP, HPPLUS
HP 95/100/200LX:    VERS_SLOW, VERS_ASM, VERS_LAP, HPLX
